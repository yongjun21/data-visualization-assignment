    <blockquote>
      This visualization shows global surface temperature change over time using
      data from GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP). I plotted mean
      surface temperatures against the year they are recorded from 1880 to 2015.
      The chart is broken down into temperature in the Northern hemisphere and
      temperature in the Southern hemisphere. On top of the scatter plot, I
      overlayed LOESS smoothed curves with 90% confidence interval band to
      further highlight the trend. We can see that surface temperature had risen
      almost 1.2Â°C in the last century. The rise is more pronounced in the
      Northern hemisphere.
